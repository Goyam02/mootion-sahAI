# API Reference

This is a contract-style reference for the current Mootion backend endpoints.

## How To Read This File

For each endpoint, ask:

- what job does it do?
- when should the frontend call it?
- what data does it expect?
- what does it return?

The detailed behavior is documented in the domain docs:

- `AUTH_AND_RBAC.md`
- `ONBOARDING_AND_CLASSES.md`
- `CURRICULUM_MANUAL_FLOW.md`
- `CURRICULUM_PATCHING.md`
- `CHAPTERS.md`
- `ASSIGNMENTS.md`
- `MEDIA_AND_WORKERS.md`

## General Request Conventions

- Authenticated endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- Teacher-only endpoints use `require_teacher`.
- Student-only endpoints use `require_student`.
- Curriculum patches require `expected_version`.

## Health

### `GET /`

Why it exists:

- lightweight server health check
- useful for deployment and local boot verification

## Auth

### `POST /auth/register`

Create a new teacher or student account.

See `AUTH_AND_RBAC.md` for the login bundle and identity model.

### `POST /auth/login`

Password login for an existing account.

### `POST /auth/refresh`

Exchange a refresh token for a new access token and refresh token pair.

### `POST /auth/logout`

Revoke the current refresh-token session.

### `POST /auth/google/start`

Start Google OAuth and tell the backend whether the user is coming in as a teacher or student.

### `GET /auth/google/callback`

Finish Google OAuth and return the token bundle.

### `GET /auth/me`

Return the current authenticated user profile.

## Teachers

### `GET /teachers/me`

Teacher profile endpoint.

### `POST /teachers/onboarding/preferences`

Set teacher onboarding preferences, currently language.

### `POST /teachers/onboarding/complete`

Mark teacher onboarding complete.

### `POST /teachers/classes`

Create a class for a grade and subject.

### `GET /teachers/classes`

List classes visible to the teacher.

## Students

### `GET /students/me`

Student profile endpoint.

### `POST /students/join-class`

Join a class by class code.

### `GET /students/classes`

List classes the student belongs to.

### `POST /students/language`

Set student language preference and mark onboarding complete.

### `POST /chat-with-ai/chats`

Create a private student AI chat thread.

Optional context can inherit the current class, chapter, or assignment.

### `GET /chat-with-ai/chats`

List the current student's AI chat threads.

### `GET /chat-with-ai/chats/{chat_id}`

Fetch one AI chat thread and its context.

### `GET /chat-with-ai/chats/{chat_id}/messages`

Fetch the ordered message history for a thread.

### `POST /chat-with-ai/chats/{chat_id}/messages`

Send a message to the AI tutor.

The backend can autonomously use tools such as explanation video generation, 3D model lookup, quiz generation, and simulation generation when the request is complex or explicitly asks for them.

### `DELETE /chat-with-ai/chats/{chat_id}`

Delete a private AI chat thread.

This chat system is student-only and is separate from the teacher-facing doubt workflow.

## Curriculum

### `POST /teachers/classes/{class_id}/curriculum`

Create a manual curriculum tree for the class.

### `POST /teachers/classes/{class_id}/curriculum/bootstrap`

Create an NCERT preset curriculum for the class.

### `GET /teachers/classes/{class_id}/curriculum`

List all curricula for the class.

### `GET /teachers/classes/{class_id}/curriculum/{curriculum_id}`

Fetch one curriculum tree and version.

### `PUT /teachers/classes/{class_id}/curriculum/{curriculum_id}`

Replace curriculum metadata/tree.

### `PATCH /teachers/classes/{class_id}/curriculum/{curriculum_id}`

Apply a tree patch and create a new snapshot.

## Chapters

### `POST /teachers/classes/{class_id}/chapters/bootstrap`

Turn curriculum root children into chapter rows with placeholder assets.

See `CHAPTERS.md` for the detailed purpose and usage.

### `GET /teachers/classes/{class_id}/chapters`

List chapters for the class.

### `GET /teachers/classes/{class_id}/chapters/{chapter_id}`

Fetch chapter details, including assets and generation metadata.

## Assignments

### `POST /teachers/classes/{class_id}/assignments`

Create a class-wide assignment for a chapter and queue activity generation.

### `GET /teachers/classes/{class_id}/assignments`

List assignments for the class.

### `GET /teachers/classes/{class_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}`

Fetch one assignment and its job state.

### `GET /students/classes/{class_id}/assignments`

List assignments visible to a student for one class.

### `GET /students/classes/{class_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}`

Fetch one student-visible assignment for a class.

## Media

### `GET /media/assets/{asset_id}`

Compatibility playback endpoint that redirects to a short-lived signed object-storage URL.

Use it when a chapter asset has been generated and you need a stable browser-playable URL.

### `GET /media/assets/{asset_id}/signed-url`

Return a signed object-storage URL for the asset.

Use this when the frontend wants to fetch the signed delivery URL explicitly and manage playback itself.

Current chapter responses point `external_url` at a direct signed playback URL.

## Worker Runtime

### `python -m app.services.media_worker`

Starts a Redis-backed worker loop that processes queued media jobs.

Run multiple copies of this process to scale out generation throughput.

## Practical Flow

1. Authenticate.
2. Teacher creates or joins a class.
3. Teacher creates or bootstraps curriculum.
4. Teacher bootstraps chapters from the curriculum.
5. Teacher creates a class-wide assignment for one chapter and one activity type.
6. The backend queues generation jobs.
7. A worker generates media, uploads it to MinIO, and writes back the result.
8. The frontend polls assignment and chapter detail to show the result.
